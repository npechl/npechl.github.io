My name is Nikos, and I am a computational scientist currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics at the [Institute of Applied Biosciences](https://inab.certh.gr/), located within the [Centre for Research & Technology, Hellas](https://www.certh.gr/root.en.aspx), under the mentorship of [**Dr. Fotis Psomopoulos**](https://fpsom.github.io/). I earned my BSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. Skilled in the R programming language, I utilize its capabilities for in-depth data analysis and statistical modeling.

I have a pronounced interest in data visualization, recognizing its pivotal role in effectively communicating research findings. Crafting compelling visual representations not only deepens the understanding of intricate biological phenomena but also facilitates knowledge dissemination within the scientific community and beyond. You're welcome to explore my [*#TidyTuesday*](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) contributions on my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/npechl) for more insights into my work.
