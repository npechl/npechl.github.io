I hold a Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.\nI am highly proficient in data analysis within the R project, utilizing its extensive libraries and tools for in-depth statistical modeling and data manipulation. My expertise also extends to data visualization, where I create compelling and informative visual representations that bring complex biological data to life. This combination allows me to effectively communicate research insights, making intricate scientific concepts accessible to both the scientific community and the public. You can explore my #TidyTuesday contributions on Twitter account for examples of my work."
