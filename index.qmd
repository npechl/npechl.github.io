Hi! Welcome to my GitHub page. My name is Nikos and I'm currently working as a Bioinformatics scientist at the [Institute of Applied Biosciences](https://www.inab.certh.gr/), part of the [Centre for Research and Technology Hellas](https://www.certh.gr/root.en.aspx). I hold a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics and a diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering, both from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

My research focuses on developing open-source computational software (tools/workflows) for analysing genetics data. I am also working on making interactive web apps to help researchers interpret biodiversity datasets.
