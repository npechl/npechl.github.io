Bioinformatics [\@INAB/CERTH](https://www.inab.certh.gr/)

Hi! Welcome to my GitHub page. My name is Nikos and I'm currently working my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics at the [Institute of Applied Biosciences](https://www.inab.certh.gr/), part of the [Centre for Research & Technology, Hellas](https://www.certh.gr/root.en.aspx). I hold a Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

My research focuses on exploring the intricate relationships between soil microbiomes and global geoclimatic patterns. Through this work, I aim to uncover the complex dynamics that shape Earth's ecosystems.

How bioinformaticians react when they see sequences.<br>Just kidding! It’s actually Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston<br>from [*Only Lovers Left Alive*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1714915/).
