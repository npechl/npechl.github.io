Bioinformatics [\@INAB/CERTH](https://www.inab.certh.gr/)

Hi! Welcome to my GitHub page. My name is Nikos and I'm currently working my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics at the [Institute of Applied Biosciences](https://www.inab.certh.gr/), situated within the [Centre for Research & Technology, Hellas](https://www.certh.gr/root.en.aspx). I hold a BSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

I am deeply engaged in research that delves into the intricate relationships between soil microbiomes and global geoclimatic trends. My work aims to unravel the complexities of these interactions, shedding light on the fascinating dynamics within the Earth's ecosystems.
